/**
 * Computes the root of an IQT given a leaf, its path, and sibling nodes at each level of the tree. 
 * It iteratively incorporates the leaf or the hash from the previous level with sibling nodes using 
 * the Splicer to place the leaf or hash at the correct position based on path_indices. 
 * Then, it hashes these values together with PoseidonHasher to move up the tree. 
 * This process repeats for each level (levels) of the tree, culminating in the computation of the tree's root.
